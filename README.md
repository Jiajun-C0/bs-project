## Folder Structure

### 1. **Results**
This folder contains the circuit results and corresponding plots for each scheme.

### 2. **weekly-meeting-ppt**
This folder holds all the presentation materials from the weekly meetings. Currently, all past PowerPoint presentations (PPTs) are consolidated into a single file for ease of access. However, moving forward, each presentation will be saved as a separate file to make it easier to locate and review specific topics discussed in each meeting.
