#### Folder Structure

1. Results

This folder contains the results of circuit simulations and corresponding plots for each scheme.

2. Weekly Meeting Presentations

This folder houses all presentation materials from the weekly meetings. Currently, all past PowerPoint presentations (PPTs) have been consolidated into a single file for ease of access. Moving forward, each presentation will be saved as an individual file to facilitate easier navigation and review of specific topics discussed during each meeting.

3. Visualization Tool

This folder includes Python code that implements a visualization tool for the Bacon-Shor code. The tool provides an interactive grid that allows users to select qubit pairs for measurement and visualizes the associated stabilizers and measurements.

4. Detector Design

This folder contains diagrams illustrating the structure of detectors used in the new scheme.
